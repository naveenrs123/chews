## Getting Started

**Firebase**
- [Adding Firebase to Flutter App](https://firebase.google.com/docs/flutter/setup)
- [Firebase API Keys](https://firebase.google.com/docs/projects/api-keys#apply-restrictions)
  - NOTE: We can include Firebase API Keys in our repository without ignoring them. 
- [Firebase Security Rules](https://firebase.google.com/docs/rules/)
  - NOTE: These are apparently a pain to write but are necessary to prevent random users from accessing sensitive information through our Firebase API Keys.
- A [fun aside](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HyhO6t4fsFY) that utilizes Firebase.
